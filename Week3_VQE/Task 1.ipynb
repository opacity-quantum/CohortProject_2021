    "In this cohort project, we illustrate the VQE process using the IBM quantum computer. For Task 1, we first simulate the system with the classical algorithm. We repeat the example process of H2 and H20 molecules and generate more results for other molecules with four different methods. Hartree-Fock (HF), Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD), Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD), and Full Configuration Interaction (FCI). Using the method, we obtain the ground state PES of the molecules both on a classical computer using classical methods and the VQE simulator. \n",

    "Since the classical algorithm can make a good approximation to the weakly correlated election system, we do not see any big diverging behavior throughout the inter-atomic distance. However, as is expected, for the strongly correlated system, we can see diverging behaviors, and we often are quire off from our exact solution (FCI). \n",

This is because the H4 system has more contribution from four hydrogens being correlated. On the other hand, the LiH system shows good converging behavior because of the stable system which does not purturb system.\n",
